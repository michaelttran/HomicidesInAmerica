### Michael Tran and Noah King CS 360 Final Project

## Given a dataset regarding homicides from 1980-2014, what can we find? 
1. Is there a correlation between time of year and homicides?
2. Are guns as big of a problem as everyone thinks?
3. What are some of the rates of involuntary manslaughter and what are some states of interest?
4. What are some states of notable homicide rates?
